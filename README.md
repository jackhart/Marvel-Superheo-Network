# Marvel Network Analysis

This repo contains code and conducts a basic network analysis on [Marvel Superheroes data from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dannielr/marvel-superheroes).

- Uses [Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) packages for visualizations
- Uses [Networkx](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/) for data analysis
- Implements strategies to write faster Python code (e.g. using [numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/) arrays, apply functions, etc.)

## Getting Started

To see the analysis, go to python notebook file on GitHub.

#### Run Locally

Jupyter notebooks can be run easily through the Anaconda Prompt.  Move to the directory containing the notebook and run the following. 

```
jupyter notebook marvelNetwork.ipynb
