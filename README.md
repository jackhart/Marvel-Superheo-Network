# Marvel Network Analysis

This repo contains code and conducts a basic network analysis on [Marvel Superheroes data from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dannielr/marvel-superheroes).

- Uses [Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) packages for visualizations
- Uses [Networkx](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/) for data analysis
- Implements strategies to write faster Python code (e.g. using [numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/) arrays, apply functions, etc.)

## Getting Started

To see the notebook with all the plots on GitHub, [view the html file](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jackhart/Marvel-Superheo-Network/blob/Fix-Plots/marvelNetwork.html).  This can be done by appending  "http://htmlpreview.github.com/?" to the front of the url of the html file in this repo.   The notebook is also available as a [kernel on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jackhart0508/basic-marvel-network-analysis).

#### Run Locally

Jupyter notebooks can be easily accessed through the Anaconda Prompt.  Move to the directory containing the notebook and datasets, then run the following.

```
jupyter notebook marvelNetwork.ipynb
```
